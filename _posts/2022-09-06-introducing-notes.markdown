As always, we've got updates that you've been asking for - and we're super excited to bring them to you this month.

## Notes

Introducing notes! Just like with bookmarks, Mindi AI will analyze your notes and tag them so you can easily find them later.

## Share a collection

You can now share your collections with others. Imagine Spotify, but for the web. Include links, images, notes, videos and more.
