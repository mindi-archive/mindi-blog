Thanks for being part of [Mindi](https://mindi.ai/) while we're still in early access. 

## 🐞 Tutorial bug

Some of you have reported an issue where our welcome tutorial kept showing up. That's fixed now. Email [support@mindi.ai](mailto:support@mindi.ai) if you're still having issues.

## 💡 What can you use Mindi for?

We built Mindi primarily for busy professionals. Those too busy to bother with folders, tags, categories, or worse, saving things locally on their computers.

However, here's a few casual uses for Mindi:

📽️ Save movies or shows you'd like to watch later (we support IMDb)

📺️ Save favorite YouTube videos (music, tutorials, entertainment)

🐦️ Save favorite Tweets (simply open a tweet and click on the browser extension)

📝 Save favorite quotes (highlight any text on a webpage, right-click -> Add to Mindi) 

🛌 Save places you'd like to visit (Airbnb, Booking.com, etc.)

🛒 Save items you wish to buy (Amazon, Ebay, Etsy, Webshops)

## #️⃣ Tag search


By typing **#** into the search, you'll be able to see and search all the tags we have generated while you were saving things to Mindi.

## 🕛️ Time search

Now you can search things based on when you saved them. Let's say you want to see all the cards you've saved from yesterday, you can just type in **:yesterday** and hit enter, or click on the yesterday in the top right.

You can even mix type tags and time tags. Here's an example, where I'm looking for the videos I've saved in the last week.

## ✌️ Stay tuned for more

We're working on some exciting new stuff. One of them is letting you see all the cards that relate to each other. It's common to save things that are related to each other, whether it's a tweet, video, article, etc. More on that to come soon.
